        <p>I have always loved tech and some form of it was always been incorporated into my work and personal life. My previous work life mostly involved Digital Marketing, Administration (MS Word, Excel, Access), Campaign Coordination, Digital Design (posters, booklets, some web), organising events, online, phone and in-person communication and group facilitation. In recent years I have had to take time off to have and take care of my children, but last year I started making strides to work towards a more substantial career in tech. </p>
        
        <br/>

        <p>IT has always interested me in particular Software Development and Cybersecurity. I have dipped in and out of different languages over the years, with some Python and Javascript mainly but not to a large degree. Last year in August 2020 I settled on Java as I could do it through the eCollege and I would get an official certificate with it, which I completed in May 2021. In January 2021, I began Digital Skills lvl 6 with LyIT which I finished in August 2021 with a 91% GPA. After completing the Java Foundations Associate Certificate in May, I began the Java Associate Developer Certification Course which I am currently doing and I have just received my certificate after completing Cisco Netacad's Cybersecurity Essentials course. </p>
        
        <br/>

        <p>I have done all this as a Single Mother of two very young children in the middle of a pandemic with my support system all the way across the country and until April 2021, no childcare.</p>
        
        <br/>

        <p>This September (2021) I began a 1-year full-time Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Cybersecurity) which will be completed in August 2022. This is the most exciting and fulfilling course I have ever done. You know you are on the right track when you genuinely look forward to your project Designing a Database or Website or your labs of Java programming. I live and breathe this course and can't wait to get out there and start working in this area.</p>
        
        <br/>

        <p>This last year has taught me a lot, it has taught me that when I really want to do something I will find a way to do it and that I have the steel determination to do it well. I love problem-solving and creating through programming and I can't wait for this to be my career. Br√≠d McDevitt is one of my references, please feel free to contact her as

        <br/>
        
        <p>I look forward to hearing more from you.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Kind regards,</p>
       <br/>
        <p>Grace</p>
